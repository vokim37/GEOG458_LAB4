#### Kim Vo - Web Mapping using Mapbox Studio

[Link to map](http://students.washington.edu/vokim/LightRailStations.html)

Data:
* Light Rail stations scraping from http://soundtransit.org
* Converted to [geojson file](https://github.com/UW-Geog458-Win2018/vokim37/blob/master/Lab4/stations.geojson)

Reflective Analysis:

This map shows the location of 16 light rail stations, from University of Washington to Angle Lake. Each station has a popup feature that shows station name and the address. My initial approach was to also include the route and display how long it takes between each station. However, I could not find data the light rail route. My map can be improved by adding more features for better interaction that Mapbox GL JS provides such as Navigation Control, Geolocate Control, Scale, and other mouse events.
